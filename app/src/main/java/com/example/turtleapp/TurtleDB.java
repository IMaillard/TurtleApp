While they are mostly aquatic, these diurnal turtles also enjoy a dry, warm place where they can climb out and bask under a heat light. Turtles are social animals and can be kept together as long as you provide enough space in their habitat.",
            "Native to Asia, these small tortoises enjoy burrowing and roaming about their habitat. In nature, they live in deep burrows underground, which enables them to withstand wide environmental temperature variations. With a long life span of 50+ years, Russian tortoises can be companions for life.",
            "Redfoot tortoises are reptiles with incredibly bold personalities. Their popularity can be attributed to their looks as well as their relatively small size. They are also very intelligent animals and may approach you to see if you have any food for them.",
            "Hermann\'s tortoises are gentle, surprisingly active pets with a beautiful yellow and brown pattern on their carapace."

            "The Russian tortoise's natural diet consists of herbaceous and succulent vegetation including grasses, twigs, flowers and some fruits. These tortoises DO NOT EAT ANIMAL PROTEIN! The best diet is one that comes as close as possible to their natural diet, which is high fiber, low protein, and calcium rich.",
            "Red-footed tortoises are generally herbivores but will eat carrion and slow-moving invertebrates such as slugs and snails: The bulk of the diet should consist of dark leafy greens and broad-leaf graze. Also offer a variety of chopped vegetables, hay, some berries, and other fruits.",
            "A Hermann's tortoise's diet consists of vegetation. Good foods include dandelion, clover, honeysuckle, leafy salads, watercress, curly kale, brussel tops, spring greens, coriander, parsley, rocket, carrot, parsnip, courgette and bell peppers. The bulk of the vegetation should be leafy greens."
